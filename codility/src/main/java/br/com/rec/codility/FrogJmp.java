	 * A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is
	 * currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater
	 * than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.
	 * 
	 * Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to
	 * reach its target.
	 * 
	 * Write a function:
	 * 
	 * int solution(int X, int Y, int D);
	 * 
	 * that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of
	 * jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.
	 * 
	 * For example, given:
	 * 
	 * X = 10 Y = 85 D = 30 the function should return 3, because the frog will
	 * be positioned as follows:
	 * 
	 * after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40 after the second jump, at
	 * position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70 after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30
	 * + 30 = 100 Assume that:
	 * 
	 * X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000]; X â‰¤ Y.
	 * Complexity:
	 * 
	 * expected worst-case time complexity is O(1); expected worst-case space
	 * complexity is O(1).
